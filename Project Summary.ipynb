    "INX Future Inc Employee Performance - Project\n",
    "INX Future Inc , (referred as INX ) , is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider\n",
    "with over 15 years of global business presence. INX is consistently rated as top 20 best employers past 5\n",
    "years. INX human resource policies are considered as employee friendly and widely perceived as best\n",
    "practices in the industry.\n",
    "Recent years, the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this is becoming a growing\n",
    "concerns among the top management. There has been increased escalations on service delivery and\n",
    "client satisfaction levels came down by 8 percentage points.\n",
    "CEO, Mr. Brain, knows the issues but concerned to take any actions in penalizing non-performing\n",
    "employees as this would affect the employee morale of all the employees in general and may further\n",
    "reduce the performance. Also, the market perception best employer and thereby attracting best talents\n",
    "to join the company.\n",
    "Mr. Brain decided to initiate a data science project , which analyses the current employee data and find\n",
    "the core underlying causes of this performance issues. Mr. Brain, being a data scientist himself, expects\n",
    "the findings of this project will help him to take right course of actions. He also expects a clear indicators\n",
